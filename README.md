# ICOnator FAQ Questions

This git repository aims to compile common and highly relevant FAQ *questions* to be used in ICO websites. No answers 
are provided, due to obvious reasons: each ICO should have different and particular answers.

> **IMPORTANT:** This document should be used as a starting point to have a great FAQ section on your ICO website, and 
> not an out-of-the-box questionnaire that you can simply copy and paste. Remember: a great FAQ session is composed by having 
> a balance between general and specific information related to the ICO project.

The symbol `[PLEASE_FILL]` is used in some of the questions.
